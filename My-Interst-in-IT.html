 I have been interested in IT since I was a teenager and I had learnt computers in high school,<br>
 once I left school I persuaded an interest in the IT industry with a few short courses<br> 
 mainly in computer maintenance and web design, with basics in networking – wired networks <br>
 and wireless networks. I have had – and still have an interest in pc gaming and once <br>
&nbsp; I found out there was a course in digital and interactive games I perused that and did the course,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
 then I took some time off “looking for work in the games industry” but because 99% of the work <br>
 is overseas and I thought I should look here at a career in IT with in Australia.<br>
 I found a company in the IT field and applied for a job with them and was accepted<br>
 as an intern until I get my “diploma” which is why I am currently studying the Bachelor of IT<br>
 at RMIT to formalise myself taught background in IT and then to move on to paid work <br>
 within the company that I currently work for as an intern.
