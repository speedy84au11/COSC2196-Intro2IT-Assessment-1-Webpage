Discord Bot – the bot would be an interactive bot that you can interact with using commands&nbsp;<br>
 (to play games or send messages to other members of the discord server) and also have a function &nbsp;<br>
 to be able to automatically post when required either by using a timer or when someone starts streaming &nbsp;<br>
 on a platform like twitch, YouTube etc. Yes there are plenty of discord bots out there but you have &nbsp;<br>
 to have many bots to be able to have the functions you want and by creating this bot it will have the most &nbsp;<br>
 used functions of other bots rolled into one bot.&nbsp;<br>

The motivation behind creating this bot is that you would not need several bots in your discord server &nbsp;<br>
to do the many functions that they have, but roll all of the most used functions into one bot to make the use&nbsp;<br>
 of the other bots redundant and there for be the best bot to use on any discord server. This is so it will&nbsp;<br>
 condense the bots list on any discord server down to one bot. If the bot is coded right it will be self-automated&nbsp;<br>
 and will help moderate discord servers, this will help if the moderators / admin are busy or not online to moderate&nbsp;<br>
 the discord server as a human can’t be on discord 24/7 watching / moderating the discord from users that would want &nbsp;<br>
 to post things that shouldn’t be there.&nbsp;<br>

Some of the features that the bot would have is to be able to post memes when a command is typed into the text chat channels&nbsp;<br>
 with in the discord server that the bot is a part of, it will be able to send text chat that has been predefined &nbsp;<br>
 “comments” i.e (bots name) sees (member name) and will chase them if provoked. (Text command - `chase @membersname)&nbsp;<br>
As the bot I am creating is called Dropbear the “game” that it plays (listed under the bot name) is &nbsp;<br>
1, lurking in trees, 2, hunting people, 3, killing people and 4, eating people. (This is a little quirk I added to the bot because of the name I had given it). &nbsp;<br>
There are other features of the bot are that when someone joins the discord it will send a custom message in the general chat like,&nbsp;<br>
 OOOO I see fresh meat to stalk etc., there will be several “quotes/sayings/messages” that will randomly be &nbsp;<br>
 chosen to post when someone new enters the server. &nbsp;<br>
Another feature is that when someone goes live on a streaming platform like Twitch, Facebook etc.&nbsp;<br>
 It will post a notification to a designated text channel with in the discord to let everyone know when &nbsp;<br>
 they are live on that platform or on YouTube if a new video is posted by someone you have told the bot to look &nbsp;<br>
 for when they post a new video – like someone you follow on that platform.&nbsp;<br>
There will be a feature where you can get music to listen to in a voice chat channel that would be sent from places &nbsp;<br>
like Spotify etc., where you can get free music from to listen too.&nbsp;<br>
It will be a basic all around bot with the most used features from all the other bots out there rolled into one bot. &nbsp;<br>
There will be many new commands and features with every update that the bot has, it will have at least one major update &nbsp;<br>
every year with minor updates throughout the year to improve stability through the tweaking of the code.&nbsp;<br>

The tool to get it started I have been using is the discord bot maker, that program you can find on steam &nbsp;<br>
and is relatively easy to use. When I have more knowledge on how to program ( and not break the code) &nbsp;<br>
I will move over to the text based editor Notepad++ for coding the bot where it will be easier to see the code &nbsp;<br>
and the mistakes if I break it, but for now I will be using the program (Discord bot maker) to make the base of the bot &nbsp;<br>
and make sure that I have the right frame work in place, this is for the bot to function and that it is simple to use for a simple bot creation.&nbsp;<br>

Little programing knowledge at the start but when you/I know how to code you will be fine using any text based programing editor to code the bot.&nbsp;<br>

<center>Outcome </tr>
</td>
</center>
<tr>
<td>
<center>
A functioning bot that can be deployed/hosted on the internet with now down time &nbsp;<br>
(on the exception that it is down for updates but that would only be now and then when an update&nbsp;<br>
 is required to be pushed to the bot on the hosting site.&nbsp;<br>
There will be many people that would want to use this bot and for future updated &nbsp;<br>
(from the standard basic bot) there will be a premium service where all features will be unlocked&nbsp;<br>
 for a small fee each month / yearly subscription.&nbsp;<br>
