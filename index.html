<h3>
My Project idea <br>
</h3>
The project idea that you put forward should have elements of originality and innovation,<br>
it does not have to be re-inventing the wheel - but isn’t to be cloning an existing product or service and doing a minor change.<br>
Note: There are to be significant tangible artifacts towards the project completion that are delivered by the submission of ASSIGNMENT 3,<br>
so keep this in mind when brainstorming your IT Project Idea – Feasibility is a key factor.
